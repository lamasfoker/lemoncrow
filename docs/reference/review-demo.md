# Reproduce the LemonCrow Review demo

This is the short version: create the prepared demo repository and open the same Review surface shown on the website and in the README.

From a LemonCrow source checkout:

```bash
./demo/review-surfaces/bootstrap.sh /tmp/lemoncrow-review-demo
uv run lc review --repo-root /tmp/lemoncrow-review-demo --setup
uv run lc review --repo-root /tmp/lemoncrow-review-demo --open
```

If your local `lc` command already points at this checkout, you can use `lc` instead of `uv run lc`.

The same steps as `make` targets (all accept `DEMO_DIR=/path`, default `/tmp/lemoncrow-review-demo`):

```bash
make review-demo          # create or reset the demo repository and open it in the Reader
make review-demo-diff     # show the prepared, uncommitted demo change
make review-demo-plugin   # install the example CSV preview plugin
```

## What to try

In the browser Review Reader:

1. Open the web surface: only the 3 changed pages (`/pricing`, `/surfaces`, `/`) are in its picker, ranked by how much each changed; the unchanged `/team` and `/settings` are not listed.
2. Start on **Diff**.
3. Switch to **Preview** to inspect the rendered UI.
4. Switch to **Compare** to see the before/after rendering.
5. Open `media/demo.gif` (or the MP4, WAV, or PDF) and switch through **Preview / Compare / Source**.
6. Open the Storybook surface for `frontend/src/components/SurfaceCard.jsx` and compare the old and new story screenshots; the added `Components` story explains that it does not exist on the old side. The API surface likewise lists only the 3 changed requests of 6, ranked by response difference.
7. Open the evidence pane to inspect impact, verification, and provenance when available.

To see a third-party preview plugin, install the example CSV plugin and reopen the Review; `data/plans.csv` then gets an old/new table preview:

```bash
make review-demo-plugin
```

That target installs the plugin into both the source checkout and the local Review
server environment. Without it, setup names the missing `csv-table` provider and
the CSV stays reviewable as source. See [Review preview plugins](review-preview-plugins.md).
The demo also contains Markdown, API, Docker Compose, and command-backed review surfaces if you want to explore further.

Reset the demo at any time by running the bootstrap command again.
