"""Explicit fresh re-run of Review Intelligence (Phase 11 item 15b).

A fresh re-run is a reviewer/admin action that executes AI review again on the
*unchanged* Snapshot. It never fakes a Snapshot or input change: the run key
stays the same and the store inserts a new run row for it
(``claim_intelligence_run(bypass_cache=True)``). Each call is reserved against
the normal Review-wide budget. The newest ready row then serves every later
ordinary request, so reloads and identical requests keep reusing cache.

Idempotency is the action id: a replayed fresh action reuses the row its first
delivery produced (``prior_fresh_run``) instead of spending again.

Run details distinguish the three execution modes from the durable rows:
``fresh_rerun`` (an explicit re-run executed), ``executed`` (an ordinary run
that called a provider) and ``reused`` (served from an earlier row).
