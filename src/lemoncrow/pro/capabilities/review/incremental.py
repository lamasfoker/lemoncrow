"""Incremental check execution per Snapshot (Phase 9R R6, item 22).

A head run is carried forward to a later Snapshot of the same Review when
nothing it depends on changed: the same recipe digest, trusted policy,
executor class, scope (cwd and selected tests), attempt number and input
digest, run in the same executor environment. The input digest (``test_impact.RecipeSelection.input_digest``)
covers the base commit and the head content of every changed file inside the
closure of the tests that run, or the whole changed tree when no narrower
closure is known. Changed inputs produce another digest, so the run executes
again. No digest (an incomplete or unreadable change list) never carries.

Rows live in ``review_derived`` (kind ``check_carry``) on the producing
Snapshot as a pointer to its attempt evidence and go with that Snapshot. The
carried record is copied onto the current Snapshot with ``reused_from``
provenance ("reused from Snapshot N"); its typed execution still names the
Snapshot that actually ran it. Each row also stores its key components, so a
later miss names the component that changed (:func:`explain_carry`, in the
:mod:`validity` vocabulary).

Environment (Trust T3 item 1): the executor environment the current run would
record (``EnvironmentFingerprint.executor_digest``: the image, the kernel
release, each executable the recipe runs, resolved through the sandbox's PATH
and mounts with its path, version output and content digest, the toolchain and
the sandbox) must be known before the lookup and equal the one the earlier
run's own execution record states. Any unknown component makes the whole
environment unknown, and an unknown environment never carries: a hosted worker
reports its environment only with its result, so hosted head runs execute
again until workers report it ahead of dispatch.

Kill switch (Trust Gate T-J item 2): ``LEMONCROW_REVIEW_CARRY=off`` carries
nothing; every plain head run executes again (``carry_disabled``). Rows are
still recorded while it is off, so turning it back on carries again without
a data migration. A carried copy already on a Snapshot is not replayed while
carry is off or once the environment changed or is unknown: the check runs
fresh. Same-Snapshot replay of a run that executed on that Snapshot, and
shared base runs, are not carry.

lc-debt: only plain head ``run`` attempts carry; adequacy probes and autofix runs
always execute again. Upgrade: carry probes keyed by their overlay digest.
