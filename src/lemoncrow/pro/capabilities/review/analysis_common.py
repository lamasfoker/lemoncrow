"""Shared model of the artifact and infrastructure analyses (Phase 9R items 15, 31, 32, 33).

Four run-plan entries execute sandboxed analyses defined by the trusted base:

* ``migrations.execute`` -- migrations up/down against a schema fixture
  (``migration_execution.py``);
* ``artifacts.regenerate`` -- regenerate and compare generated files
  (``regenerate_compare.py``);
* ``artifacts.shipped`` -- diff shipped artifacts (``shipped_artifacts.py``);
* ``infra.render`` -- helm/kustomize render and credential-free terraform plan
  (``infra_render.py``).

Each analysis is one :class:`AnalysisSpec` (configured under ``analyses:`` in
the trusted-base ``.lemoncrow/review.yaml`` or discovered from the trusted base)
and one stdlib-only Python driver that runs inside the R4 hermetic runner as
``python3 -c <driver> <payload>``. The driver never trusts its environment:
every tool it starts gets an allowlisted environment (no provider or registry
credentials), works on a ``/tmp`` copy (the Snapshot stays untouched), and
writes one JSON report, hex-encoded so the runner's line-oriented redaction can
never corrupt its structure; the host decodes it and redacts every string
before anything is stored.
