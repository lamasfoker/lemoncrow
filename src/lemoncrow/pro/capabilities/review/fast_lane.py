"""Fast lane on eligible pushes (Phase 11 P11-FED item 4).

On a push that is eligible, the effective run plan keeps every deterministic
check and cheap rule-specific entry and skips only the broad deep-agent pass
(:data:`FAST_LANE_SKIPPED`), visibly, with the reason on the entry and the
decision on the plan. Eligibility is conservative -- any doubt keeps the full
plan:

* the Snapshot came from a push, and the previous Snapshot's persisted plan ran
  the broad AI pass (so the change was already deep-reviewed once, and two
  consecutive pushes are never both fast-laned);
* the depth is a Quick/Auto preset (Custom, profiles, Thorough and Deep ask for
  more and are never fast-laned), and the AI family is not ``always``;
* no escalation signal (risk candidates, or a P11-ESC deep-review escalation)
  and no policy depth floor (``min_effort``, which criticality policy compiles
  to) applies to the change;
* no changed path is sensitive (:data:`SENSITIVE_PATHS`: auth/security/crypto,
  secrets, billing, migrations, CI/release, Review policy, infrastructure and
  dependency manifests).

Policy-required and per-Review requested entries always keep running. Pure:
no store, no I/O.
