"""Unified validity reasons (Trust T1): one explanatory language over existing Review state.

This module owns no state. It owns the typed reason vocabulary and adapters that read
the outcome an existing authority already decided:

* human judgments: :func:`revisions.reconcile` records a reason code per mark;
* evidence freshness: :func:`freshness.assess_freshness` records a reason code;
* cross-Snapshot check carry: :func:`incremental.explain_carry`;
* typed check equivalence: :meth:`check_ingest.EquivalenceKey.mismatches`;
* readiness: the ``reason`` and cited evidence of a :class:`readiness.ReadinessCondition`.

A :class:`ValidityResult` explains; it never decides. Every reason code implies exactly
one state, so the same inputs always produce the same reason chain, and an unknown code
is refused rather than shown. The existing state contracts (mark states, freshness
states, readiness condition states) are unchanged.
