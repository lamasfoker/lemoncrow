"""Interactive side-by-side preview sessions (Phase 9R item 16, Phase 14 item 37).

A reviewer opens base and head of one exact Snapshot running side by side and
explores them. :class:`InteractivePreviewManager` owns the lifecycle:

* **admission** happens before it is called: the API admits
  ``visual.interactive_preview`` through the effective run plan as a manual
  amendment on the executor's own locus (``planned_execution``);
* **budget**: the session lifetime is capped by the remaining per-Review compute
  budget (two sides consume two compute minutes per minute) and, on the
  LemonCrow-managed executor, by the monthly managed money cap; below one
  minute the start is refused as ``Limited by budget``, and a managed session
  is stopped when the money cap is reached while it runs. Compute is recorded
  per minute while running and finally at teardown, on the planner's ledger
  (and, for managed execution, on the usage meter);
* **time limit**: every request re-checks the TTL on the injected clock and the
  sweeper tears the sandboxes down at expiry, when the Review closes, or when a
  newer Snapshot supersedes the session's Snapshot;
* **authorization**: every proxied request re-checks that the viewer still
  holds the Review (the composition decides how fresh that answer is); losing
  it ends the session;
* **comparability**: base and head are labeled comparable only under the same
  environment fingerprint;
* **recording**: what the reviewer requested on each side (redacted) plus the
  sinks' captured outbound attempts become one evidence record on the exact
  Snapshot after teardown. It is a *human observation* with no verdict: it can
  never be read as a sandbox PASS, and as execution-derived evidence only its
  title and executor class reach a model route.

Drivers (:class:`PreviewDriver`) run the sides: the author machine's
bubblewrap driver (``preview_runtime``) or a hosted worker driver. Exposures
(:class:`PreviewExposure`) give each side its own origin.

**Several serving processes.** A hosted control plane runs replicas behind one
load balancer, so the process that started a session is often not the one a
later request reaches. Everything a request needs beyond the durable session
row is in the shared :class:`~.preview_state.PreviewState`: a preview host
resolves to its session side and worker there (:class:`SharedPreviewSessions`),
tickets are taken atomically, end markers refuse a stopped session everywhere,
and exactly one process (the teardown claim) stops the sides, meters the rest
and writes the recording -- including for a session whose starting replica is
gone (orphan reaping after :data:`ORPHAN_GRACE_SECONDS`).
