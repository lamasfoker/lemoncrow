"""Read-only stack/dependency awareness (Phase 9 item 24).

LemonCrow shows where a Change sits in a stack -- its layer, the lower and
upper related Changes and their state -- and routes feedback on code a lower
layer introduced to the Change that owns it. It is **not** a stack-management
product: nothing here (or anywhere this module is called from) creates,
rebases, retargets or pushes a branch. Every projection carries
``mutation: "read_only"`` so consumers can assert it.

Two detectors feed one projection:

* **Hosted** (provider facts, ``lemoncrow_server.review.providers.stack``): a
  pull request whose base branch is another open pull request's head branch
  in the same repository is the upper layer of that pull request.
* **Local** (:func:`local_stack`): branch ancestry among captured Reviews. An
  open Review whose head commit is a strict, not-yet-integrated ancestor of
  this Review's head is a lower layer. When this Review's diff base is at (or
  above) that commit the lower layer's work is already excluded (``exact``);
  when the diff base is below it the lower work is inside this diff
  (``included``) and is attributed to the lower Change, file by file, instead
  of being presented as this layer's authored work.
