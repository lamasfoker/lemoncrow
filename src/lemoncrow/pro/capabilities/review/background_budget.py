"""Shared background-intelligence budget: one autonomous envelope, one accounting path (BI1).

Autonomous AI work -- automatic Review intelligence, knowledge refresh,
discussion summaries, learning suggestions -- draws on one shared *background*
envelope per scope (a hosted organization, or the local LemonCrow root). The
envelope is **additional** to every limit that already exists; it replaces none
of them:

* the per-operation cap (``ModelCallBudget.max_calls``),
* the capability's own bound (max model calls per execution),
* the per-Review cap (``budget.per_review_model_calls`` of the run plan, whose
  run-plan authority is unchanged),
* the hosted organization quota (``model_spend_micros``),
* and this envelope: period model calls, an optional daily guard, and managed
  spend.

Admission (:func:`decide`) grants the **most restrictive** of all of them and
names the one that bound with a stable :class:`AdmissionReason`.

**Lanes.** Explicit human work -- Ask, a manual or deeper Review, an explicit
fresh re-run -- and policy-required Review work (:attr:`JobPriority.REVIEW_REQUIRED`)
run in the :attr:`BudgetLane.INTERACTIVE` lane: metered in the same ledger, in
separate counters, and never refused because the background envelope is empty.
They still obey every other ceiling the caller composes.

**Low priority pauses first.** Within the background lane each priority may use
only its share of a ceiling (:data:`PRIORITY_ENVELOPE_PERCENT`), so as the
envelope drains ``learning_suggestion`` pauses before ``discussion_summary``,
before ``knowledge_refresh``, before ``review_auto``.

**Money is never pretended.** A dollar ceiling binds only managed execution
(LemonCrow pays the provider). A managed request whose cost cannot be estimated
is refused with :attr:`AdmissionReason.COST_UNMEASURABLE` rather than charged
as zero. Calls on local/worker routes are counted; their cost is shown only
where the provider reported one, and calls of unknown cost are counted as such.

**Exactly-once accounting.** A reservation is keyed by the caller's
idempotency key (one per execution *attempt*; only its SHA-256 digest is
stored). Reserving the same key again returns the same reservation; settling it
again with the same usage is a no-op and with different usage a
:class:`BudgetConflict`. Model calls are held at admission, so concurrent
admissions can never together exceed a call ceiling. A hold that is never
settled (a worker died with its lease) expires and is charged in full -- the
conservative reading, since the calls may have been made -- and a late truthful
settlement may still correct it once.

**Lifecycle of the durable state.** Rows are written only by :func:`reserve_in`
and :func:`settle_in`. Each reservation is charged to the period (UTC calendar
month and day) it was admitted in, so a settlement after a rollover never
touches the new period. Period and reservation rows older than the retention
horizon are deleted when a new period first opens (the rollover is the
closer), and a scope purge deletes all of them. The ledger stores no
repository, Review, path or prompt: only digests, capability ids, priorities
and counts.

This module is backend-neutral. :class:`SqlLedgerTransaction` runs the same
algorithm on SQLite (local, ``background_budget_store``) and on PostgreSQL
(hosted, the quota authority). It is a contract, not a scheduler: BI2 decides
what to run and asks this ledger whether it may.
