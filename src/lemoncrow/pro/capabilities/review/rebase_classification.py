"""Authored change vs base-only movement between two Snapshots (Phase 9 item 34).

A rebase, a merge of the integration branch, or a lower stack layer moving
underneath a Change all produce a new Snapshot whose bytes differ from the one a
reviewer judged, even when the *authored* change is exactly the same. Reopening
every judgment on such a Snapshot teaches reviewers to ignore "changed since your
review"; preserving judgments on a guess teaches them that "reviewed" lies.

This module answers the question deterministically or not at all:

**A unit moved base-only** when the diff base moved between the two Snapshots and
the authored patch of its file is *patch-equivalent* on both sides: the same
hunks, line numbers ignored and whitespace removed (git ``patch-id`` semantics,
context lines included), same status, paths, modes and submodule pointers. Its
content fingerprint may still differ (the base changed lines inside the symbol,
or around the hunk), but nothing the author wrote did.

Everything else is **authored**, including every case that cannot be decided:
an uncaptured or capped hunk body, a binary file, a file past the size bound, a
range-mode change, a packet that cannot be read. Failing conservative is the
rule; a bound never classifies as base-only.

No writes. The capture path (``sources.local.record_revision``) persists the
resulting judgment carry; surfaces only label.
