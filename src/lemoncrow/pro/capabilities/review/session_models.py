"""Durable review state -- pure data, zero I/O.

``models.py`` describes one *packet*: what a single ``lc review`` invocation
computed, thrown away when the process exits. This module describes the thing
that outlives every invocation -- the review itself: which change a human is
working through, which revisions of it they have seen, which units they marked
reviewed and against which content, and where their comments are anchored.

There is exactly one authoritative review state and it is this one. Renderers
(a browser pane, a terminal diff viewer, an agent surface) are projections of
it; none of them is a source of truth to sync *from*.

Discipline, mirrored verbatim from ``models.py``:

* ``@dataclass(frozen=True)`` throughout -- a mark that can be mutated in place
  is a mark whose fingerprint no longer describes what was reviewed.
* Every collection field defaults to ``()`` and every unknown scalar to a
  sentinel, so a partially-filled record is valid rather than a crash.
* Fields are **appended, never inserted or renamed**, and the SQL columns behind
  them are added with a default. See ``SESSION_SCHEMA_VERSION``.
* ``Literal`` + a module-level ``_VALUES`` tuple instead of ``enum.Enum``: the
  release wheel compiles this package with mypyc, which ``enum`` does not
  survive (``tests/test_mypyc_compile_safety.py`` enforces it).

Sync-friendliness is a design constraint, not an aspiration. A hosted team
service must be able to replicate these rows without a rewrite, so: ids are
client-generated and globally unique (UUIDv7 text behind a 3-letter prefix,
sortable by creation time), timestamps are aware-UTC ISO-8601 text, and **no
primary key contains a local filesystem path**. ``repo_root`` is an ordinary
attribute of a session, never part of its identity.

No I/O lives here, and nothing in this module imports ``store.py``.
