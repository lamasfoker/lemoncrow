"""The local review source: git range → packet → units → a persisted revision.

This is the only module that knows how a working tree becomes durable review
state. Everything under it is pure: ``packet.py`` composes analyses,
``units.py`` derives identity and fingerprints, ``store.py`` writes rows. The
orchestration — which session to reopen, whether this content is a new revision
at all, what gets written to disk as the record — lives here and nowhere else,
so the CLI and (later) the workspace API drive exactly the same sequence.

Two invariants it exists to hold:

**Reopen, never re-create.** A second ``lc review`` on the same repository and
the same range finds the session that already exists. A review whose marks reset
on every invocation is not review state, it is a cache.

**Identical content is not a new revision.** The packet is fingerprinted into a
``tree_fingerprint`` before anything is written; if that fingerprint is already
on file, the existing revision is returned and no row, no artifact and no mark
moves. Without this, running the command twice would strand every mark made
against the first run.

    spelling any surface prints, so a reviewer can type back the word they were
    just shown (reader spec §29.3, "accept target labels/unit keys cleanly").

    A ``hun:``/``sym:`` key and a target label each name one judgment and are
    left exactly as typed: they are the precise forms, and widening one would
    store verdicts the reviewer never asked for.

    A repo-relative path and the file's ``fil:`` key are the same imprecise
    claim -- "I read this file" -- and both expand to every current
    :class:`~lemoncrow.pro.capabilities.review.targets.ReviewTarget` on that
    path. :func:`resolve_unit` answers both with the file unit, but no target is
    keyed to a file unit unless the whole file *is* the one target -- so a
    verdict parked there moves no progress count and no closure count, and the
    only mark either spelling could ever create was invisible to every number
    printed beside it. Expanding puts the same claim on the judgments the file
    actually contains.

    **A real path outranks a label that merely reads like one.** Labels are
    path-shaped (``src/app.py#0``, ``src/app.py::two``), so nothing stops a
    repository from containing a changed file spelled exactly like some other
    file's target label. Trying the label first sent a verdict on the file the
    reviewer named into a judgment inside a different file, and the widening
    disclosure -- which fires only when the resolution widened -- made that
    silent. The file the repository actually contains wins, and the label it beat
    comes back in :attr:`MarkResolution.shadowed` so the caller can name what it
    did not do. A label colliding with no path still resolves to its one target.

    Expansion is against *targets* as this revision derives them. A later
    revision that splits the path into more targets leaves the new ones
    unreviewed, which is correct: nobody has looked at them.

    Empty ``units`` when nothing matches, so the caller can refuse a stale path
    instead of recording silence. A caller holding no target view at all --
    *targets* empty, or derived against some other revision -- still gets the
    file unit back for a path this revision contains, because a match must never
    be a no-op.

    header they print is counting from. A surface that derives its own baseline
    is a surface that will eventually name a different window than the frontier
    beside it, which is how a destroyed verdict came to be reported on exactly
    one revision. *marks* is an optimisation for a caller that has already read
    them; leaving it out reads this reviewer's marks from the store.

    Not ``latest_revision``: that one is advanced by whoever ran the last

    be answered with it. Reading the frontier off the store's newest row is what
    made ``lc review --comments`` and ``lc review --since-my-review`` answer
    differently depending on which one the developer typed first.

    The evidence is :meth:`ReviewStore.frontier_revision` -- a row written when
    the reviewer records a verdict, and never by merely looking. It **wins
    outright** when it is there. The marks are a fallback for a store written
    before that table existed, and only that: taking the newer of the two was a
    second high-water mark over ``revision_number``, and after an undo it names
    a revision the reviewer has moved on from -- a mark recorded against
    revision 2 outvoting the frontier row that says their last look was
    revision 1, and every unit revision 2 lacked then reported as new.

    The marks alone are **not** enough, and that is the bug this signature
    exists to close. Reconciliation deletes a mark whose unit left the review --
    rename the one symbol a reviewer approved and their only mark is cleared --
    so a baseline derived from marks alone evaporates at the exact moment the
    reviewer most needs to be told what moved. Whichever command reconciled
    first ate their history, and every later command then reported "nothing
    reviewed yet" about code they had reviewed.

    ``None`` before their first verdict, and that is the honest answer: a
    reviewer who has recorded nothing has seen no revision, so every unit is new

    *checkpoint_history* records a commit checkpoint the working tree has
    already moved past (a partial commit, say). Such a checkpoint lacks the
    still-uncommitted files, which have not left the Review, so a mark whose
    unit is merely absent from it is kept for the draft capture that follows
    instead of being discarded.

    *legacy_source_fingerprint* is the commit-id form of the source identity
    *source_fingerprint_override* names (see ``gitdiff.SourceState``), so a
    Snapshot recorded before the tree-id identity still counts as unchanged.

    This is the only function in the system that writes a revision, and it is
    the only one that carries marks and comment anchors onto it. That is not a
    convenience: splitting the two is the defect this shape exists to make
    unrepresentable. When a plain ``lc review`` could record revision 2 without
    reconciling, the *next* command found ``latest_revision`` already equal to
    the revision it was about to take, concluded nothing had happened, and left
    a human's ``reviewed`` standing over rewritten code and a comment labelled
    "file unchanged since the comment" on a file that had been rewritten. The
    stale verdict was then permanent, because no later run would ever see a
    transition to reconcile. There is no snapshot-without-reconcile door left to
    walk through: :func:`snapshot_revision` calls this and throws away the rest.

    Order is the point. The baseline revision's units and the reviewer's marks
    are read **before** the write, because the write is what makes them
    previous; reading them afterwards compares the new revision against itself
    and reports that nothing ever changes.

    The baseline is the revision *this reviewer last looked at* -- see
    :func:`baseline_revision` -- and not the store's newest row. Now that every
    path records, "the previous revision" is whatever the last command happened
    to do, and a question phrased "what changed since **I** reviewed" cannot be
    answered with it.

    Idempotent, and not by way of a "did I just create it" flag:

    * Identical content fingerprints to the revision already on file, so no row
      and no artifact are written.
    * Reconciliation is decided on ``content_fingerprint``, so re-running it
      over the marks it just produced is a fixed point -- every mark comes back
      ``carried`` and nothing is written.
    * Re-anchoring is skipped only for an annotation whose stored geometry was
      *derived from this revision* -- its newest anchor event is one recorded
      here -- so the append-only audit table grows only when something actually
      resolved, and the row is never left describing a different revision. The
      weaker test ("any event on this revision") is what a revert defeats:
      content that changed and changed back resolves to an *older* stored
      revision the comment already owns its origin event on, and the comment
      would then keep the geometry of the revision in between -- a line and a
      function name that exist nowhere in the tree. A ``created`` flag is no
      better: it reads false forever on exactly that revision.

    The packet is persisted as an artifact rather than rebuilt on demand. A
    working-tree new-side blob is gone the instant the file is saved again, so a
    rebuild would silently re-anchor the review to different content and every
    mark would then be describing something nobody reviewed.

    ``with_patch_text=True`` is what makes hunk fingerprints content-derived
    rather than geometry-derived; it costs the diff walk one string per hunk and
    is off everywhere else.

    *build* lets a caller that has **already built and displayed** a packet hand
    it over instead of paying for a second impact pass. It carries the packet
    *and* the blob texts that produced it, and the pairing is the point: a
    packet alone would force this function to re-read the working tree, and any
    file saved between the two reads would be stored as content A under
    fingerprints describing content B. A reviewer must never mark a packet they
    were not shown. Pass a build made with ``with_patch_text=True``; one without
    hunk bodies still snapshots, with ``unknown`` hunk fingerprints.
