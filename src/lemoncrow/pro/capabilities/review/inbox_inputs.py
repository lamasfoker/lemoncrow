"""Bulk, body-free Inbox inputs shared by the local and hosted Inbox (P9-INBOX).

Each loader is one store read per 500 Snapshots, whatever the Review count, and
reads only stored projections: the P9-PRIO triage row plus its override events,
the readiness record, the fact watermark, the post-merge ledger rows and the
break-glass records (outcomes only for the rare Reviews that have one). No
packet, unit, source or comment body is opened.
