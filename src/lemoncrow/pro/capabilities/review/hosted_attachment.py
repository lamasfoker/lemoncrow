"""Local <-> hosted Review attachment (G5-SYNC): queue guards, conflict rules, reconnect.

The contract is "G5-SYNC contract" in
``docs/planning/2026-10-05-production-guarantees-plan.md``. In short:

* A local Review is fully usable alone. Attaching it to a hosted Review is
  explicit; from then on hosted owns comments, judgments, requests, outcomes
  and policy satisfaction.
* The local Review keeps a *projection* (the hosted state last read) and a
  queue of explicitly queued actions, each bound to the hosted Snapshot it was
  made on plus compare-and-set preconditions read from that projection.
* Reconnect replays the queue in order. Hosted evaluates every precondition
  inside one Review transition and answers ``applied`` or ``conflict`` with a
  reason; nothing is merged, rebased or carried forward silently.

Everything here is pure or talks through the two small ports below, so the
same rules run in the local Reader API (queue guards), the hosted server
(:func:`conflict_reason`) and the client (:func:`reconnect`).
