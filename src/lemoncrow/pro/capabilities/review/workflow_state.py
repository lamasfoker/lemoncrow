"""Review workflow state, derived independently from priority (Phase 9 item 2, P9-INBOX).

One Review-level field that says *where the work stands*:

``needs_review | waiting_on_reviewer | waiting_on_author | waiting_on_checks |
needs_decision | ready_to_merge | monitoring | closed``

It sits next to -- and is never merged with -- the P9-PRIO ``priority`` (what to
open first), the ReviewAttention next-action owner (who acts next) and the
P10-READY readiness record (whether merge conditions hold). Each of those can
change while the others stay put.

Derivation is deterministic and ordered (first matching rule wins, and the rule
name is returned so the decision is explainable):

1. ``closed`` / ``monitoring`` -- a finished, archived or merged Review is
   ``monitoring`` only while a post-merge action is still running, else
   ``closed``.
2. A reviewer holds the turn (reviewer-side ReviewAttention reasons or threads
   returned to a reviewer): ``waiting_on_reviewer`` when the Review already
   carries review evidence, else ``needs_review``.
3. An author or authoring agent holds the turn (author-side reasons, request-
   change threads waiting on the author, feedback handed to an agent, a failed
   required check): ``waiting_on_author``.
4. A person must decide something the facts name (landing attention, scope
   reconciliation, a manual attention reason): ``needs_decision``.
5. Review is not complete on the current Snapshot: ``needs_review``. Missing
   evidence never reads as safe -- an unreviewed Review with no findings lands
   here, never in ``ready_to_merge``.
6. Required checks are pending on a fresh readiness record: ``waiting_on_checks``.
7. The readiness record is fresh, current-Snapshot and ready: ``ready_to_merge``.
   This is the only route to ``ready_to_merge``.
8. Otherwise ``needs_decision``: review is complete but readiness is not ready,
   stale or was never evaluated, so a person decides.

The readiness record is the compact summary the Reader persists whenever it
evaluates readiness (:func:`persist_readiness_summary`). Readiness is evaluated
*as a reviewer* (``latest-snapshot-reviewed`` counts that reviewer's judgment),
so the record is kept per evaluator and the Inbox reads only the viewer's own.
It is fresh only when it belongs to the current Snapshot, was evaluated no
earlier than the newest durable Review fact (the *watermark*: marks, comments,
outcomes, evidence, relationships; hosted adds requests and provider facts) and
its time-sensitive evidence has not expired. Anything else is ``stale`` or
``unknown`` and can never produce ``ready_to_merge``.

Writes: one ``review_derived`` row per (Snapshot, evaluator) (kind
``readiness_summary``); the Snapshot's deletion cascade owns its retention.
Nothing here writes readiness conditions, merge eligibility, assignment or
permissions.
