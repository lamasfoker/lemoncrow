"""Compute saved versus spent per Review (Phase 9R R6).

What the execution economy avoided, next to what the Review spent:

* ``base_shared`` -- a base run reused from another Review on the same base
  commit, environment and recipe (item 21); measured: the original run's time.
* ``carried_forward`` -- a head run reused from an earlier Snapshot whose inputs
  did not change (item 22); measured: the original run's time.
* ``ci_reuse`` -- an entry an equivalent current-Snapshot CI or LemonCrow result
  satisfies (item 23); estimated: the entry's planned minutes.
* ``impact_selection`` -- test files impact selection left out (item 19);
  estimated: the entry's planned minutes times the share of test files not run.

Measured rows live in ``review_derived`` (kind ``compute_saved``, one row per
entry and reason) and are deleted with their Snapshot. Estimated rows are
derived from the persisted run plan on read. A base run left out because the
head passed (item 20) is not counted: nothing measured what it would cost.
