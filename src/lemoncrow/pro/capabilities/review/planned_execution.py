"""Run-plan admission and compute reporting for hermetic executions.

The effective run plan governs what executes. A hermetic executor (author
machine, customer worker, managed sandbox) runs a catalog entry only when the
Snapshot's persisted plan schedules it (``run``) on that executor's own locus:
``author_machine`` runs ``local`` entries, ``customer_worker`` ``worker``
entries and ``managed_sandbox`` ``managed`` entries. A hosted dispatcher states
its locus explicitly (``RunnerRegistry.run_on``), because a customer-operated
deployment's ``managed`` plane is customer compute. Anything else -- no plan, a
tampered plan, an entry the plan skips or places elsewhere -- is refused.

In-process executions report per-stage compute (fetch/build/run from the
execution contract) through the planner's ``ComputeRecorder``. Hosted jobs are
metered from their durable leases (``compute_usage``) and are never reported
here, so no execution is counted twice.
