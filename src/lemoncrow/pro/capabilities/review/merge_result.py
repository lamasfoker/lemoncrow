"""Re-validate what actually lands: the merge result (Phase 10 item 18, P10-LAND).

The reviewed Snapshot is not what lands: the provider merges the head onto the
current base, plus whatever merged since review. When the provider builds the
merge result (GitHub ``merge_group`` for a merge queue, or checks reported on
the pull request's test-merge commit), the same checks are compared on three
sides, per stable check identity:

* **merge** -- the merge result;
* **head** -- the reviewed Snapshot's head;
* **base** -- the merge result's base: the provider's results on that base
  commit, which every Change queued on the same base shares (the R6 rule: the
  base side runs once per base commit, never per Change).

lc-debt: compares provider/CI checks on the three commits; LemonCrow-executed
Phase 9R recipes and behavior diffs do not run on the merge target yet (check
runs have only old/new sides), so ``behavior`` is empty and an R6 shared base
run is not reused here. Upgrade: a ``merge`` side in ``check_runs`` keyed by
the merge commit, reading its base side from ``base_results.find_shared_base``.

A check that passes on the head and does not fail on the base but fails on the
merge result is a **new failure**; a behavior key whose merge-result outcome
matches neither side is a **semantic conflict**. Either blocks landing (the
``merge-result`` readiness condition fails, so arming is refused and an armed
landing is withdrawn by the one revalidation path). A failure the base already
has is inherited, never blamed on this Change, and source judgments are never
touched: this is a landing gate, not a re-review.

Typed required checks (``landing.merge_result.required_checks``, RC11): each
named check identity must pass on the merge result *from its named producer
class* (``SideResult.source``). A same-identity row from another class (a
provider CI row standing in for a LemonCrow verification) never satisfies it:
missing or mistyped stays ``pending`` (landing waits; never a pass), and a
required check failing on the merge result fails the condition even when the
base fails it too. Every merge-result row is ``provider_ci`` today, so policy
refuses the other classes (``landing_policy.PRODUCED_MERGE_CHECK_CLASSES``)
until something produces them on the merge result.

No merge result yet is ``pending`` and SCM-owned (the merge queue builds it
only after landing is armed, so it can never block arming) when policy requires
merge-result checks; without that policy and without a result, no condition is
shown at all. Pure: classification and the readiness condition only.
