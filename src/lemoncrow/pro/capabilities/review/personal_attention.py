"""Personal attention: how much one Review needs *this viewer*, separate from priority (Phase 9 item 6).

Global ``priority`` (P9-PRIO) says what the organization should open first;
personal attention orders one viewer's Inbox. It reads, never writes: the
result is a score plus every factor that contributed, so the order is
explainable and nothing here can change priority, readiness, assignment or
permissions.

Factors (integer points, so equal evidence always yields an equal score):

* **next-action ownership** -- the strongest ReviewAttention reason the viewer
  holds (returned work outranks a fresh request, which outranks a mention);
* **waiting age** -- how long the viewer's oldest reason has waited;
* **activity** -- the Review changed in the last day;
* **assignment / team** -- a direct request, else a request to one of the
  viewer's teams (actual requests only, never suggestions);
* **engagement** -- the viewer already participates;
* **impact** -- the Review's priority and criticality (read, never changed);
* **expected review effort** -- smaller remaining work first, when known.

Order: score descending, then the oldest waiting reason first, then repository
and Review id. The id tiebreak makes the order total and deterministic.
