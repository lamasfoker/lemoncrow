"""Effective data flow for one repository: where source, code and evidence may travel.

One builder serves both surfaces: ``lc review data-flow`` (local) and
``GET /v1/repos/{repo_id}/data-flow`` (hosted). It adds no policy and no
parallel mechanism. Every row is derived from the seam that already enforces
it: run settings (``run_plan``), AI content access (``rules``), hermetic
execution policy (``hermetic``), model routes (``intelligence_runtime``,
``independence``), custom model endpoints (``model_setup``) and evidence
connectors (``outcomes``). Every row cites the setting and the policy layer it
came from.

Two invariants hold for every row:

* An unknown is an explicit ``unknown`` row with its reason. It is never
  omitted and never reported as ``allowed``.
* Environment *values* never enter the projection, except validated driver
  names (a closed vocabulary), sanitized model ids and numbers. Proxy, CA,
  storage URLs and file paths are reported by setting *name* only.
