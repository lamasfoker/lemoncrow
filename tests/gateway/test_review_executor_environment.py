"""The executor environment probe a carry depends on (Trust T3 item 1 fixes).

The probe resolves what a recipe actually runs through the sandbox's PATH and
mounts, records each executable's resolved path, version output and content
digest with the host image and kernel release, and caches nothing by process:
every cached probe is keyed by the binary's on-disk identity, so an upgrade under
a running server is probed again. Any unknown component makes the whole
environment unknown (``""``), so it never carries.
