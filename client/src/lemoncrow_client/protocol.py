"""What this client declares at the handshake.

The server refuses a client that does not offer ``blob_miss.v1``, and it is
right to: a client that cannot answer ``{"need": [...]}`` turns every cold read
into a hard failure, and from the server's side that is indistinguishable from
a broken client. So the required capability is not a constant this module may
drift from -- it is the set :mod:`lemoncrow_client.blobs` actually implements,
and ``tests/test_contract_conformance.py`` asserts the two agree with the
server's own ``REQUIRED_CLIENT_CAPABILITIES`` when the server is importable.

The protocol version is a date string. The client speaks two: N
(:data:`PROTOCOL_VERSION`) and N-1 (:data:`PREVIOUS_PROTOCOL_VERSION`), the
same window the server serves. :func:`negotiate_protocol` offers N and steps
down to N-1 once when a server one version behind refuses N. Anything else is
refused loudly at ``POST /v1/handshake`` before authentication, naming the
side to upgrade, so a client that must be upgraded learns that instead of
seeing a confusing 401. ``lemoncrow_server_core.protocol`` documents how a
version is cut and N-1 retired.

Review features are gated on the server's Review capability manifest
(:class:`ReviewManifest`). An unsupported feature degrades with "this server
does not support X"; a write the server could only apply partially is refused
before it is sent.
